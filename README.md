# CS-320
To ensure that my code, program, or software is both functional and secure, I follow a combination of testing, validation, and best practices. I write and run unit tests to verify that each part of the program works as intended and use integration and user testing to confirm that the overall system behaves correctly. I also implement input validation and proper authentication methods to help protect against security threats such as SQL injection or unauthorized access. To interpret user needs, I listen carefully to what users are trying to accomplish and gather feedback through surveys, interviews, or test sessions. I then translate those needs into specific software requirements and features. When designing software, I start by identifying the core problem, then break it down into manageable pieces, often creating diagrams or mockups to organize ideas and visualize the user’s experience. I follow an iterative process, building and refining the design step by step while continuously checking that it aligns with the users’ goals and expectations.
